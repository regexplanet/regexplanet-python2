# regexplanet-python2

This is the Python v2 backend for RegexPlanet, a tool for online regular expression testing.

It is no longer actively monitored or maintained.  See [regexplanet-python3](https://github.com/regexplanet/regexplanet-python3) for the Python v3 version.

However, it may still work: try hitting it with the [`testurl` parameter](https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/python/index.html?testurl=https://regexplanet-python.appspot.com/test.json).  It will probably be quite a cold start, so be patient.
